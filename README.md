# BMI Calculator

A simple web application that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight and height. This project was developed to enhance my understanding of JavaScript and web development concepts.

## Features

- Input fields for user name, weight, and height.
- Calculates BMI using the formula: BMI = weight / (height ^ 2).
- Displays the calculated BMI with two decimal points.
- Provides feedback on whether the user's weight falls within the appropriate BMI range.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and creating a modern look.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the BMI calculation logic and user interactions.

## Learning Points

In this project, I aimed to explore the following concepts:

1. **DOM Manipulation**: Gaining experience in accessing and modifying HTML elements using JavaScript.
2. **Event Handling**: Implementing event listeners to respond to user actions, such as clicking the "Send" button.
3. **Input Validation**: Ensuring that all input fields are filled correctly before performing calculations.
4. **Mathematical Calculations**: Applying mathematical formulas within JavaScript to perform calculations based on user input.
5. **Conditional Logic**: Using if-else statements to provide feedback based on the calculated BMI value.
6. **Styling with CSS**: Creating a visually appealing interface while keeping the layout responsive.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thiag0-hir0sue/BMI-calculator.git

2. Open index.html in your web browser.

3. Enter your name, weight (in kg), and height (in meters).

4. Click the "Send" button to calculate your BMI.

5. The result will be displayed on the screen, along with feedback regarding your BMI category.

<b>Future Improvements</b>

Add more detailed BMI categories (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese) and corresponding health tips.
Implement responsive design for better mobile usability.
Explore incorporating a history feature to track previous BMI calculations.
